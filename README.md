Coinmetrics.io, one of the leading data aggregators and open source analytics websites has done a great job on a number of fronts. We here at Altus Squared believe their data to be of the highest quality as it comes directly from full nodes with the exception of Ripple and Stellar. This basic R script aggregates this data for ease of use.
